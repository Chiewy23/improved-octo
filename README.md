# Improved-Octo

Desktop app for typing Greek symbols using a standard English keyboard.

Useful for Classics students or hobbyists of Ancient Greek.

Running the app produces a Tkinter editor with two text areas; one for input
and the second for output. Typing into the first text area produces the equivalent
Greek character for each given input character.

If no such Greek character is assigned to a given input, nothing is output.
